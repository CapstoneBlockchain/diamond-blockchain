Install Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before we begin, if you haven't already done so, you may wish to check that
you have all the :doc:`prereqs` installed on the platform(s)
on which you'll be developing blockchain applications and/or operating
Hyperledger Fabric.

Install Binaries and Docker Images
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While we work on developing real installers for the Hyperledger Fabric
binaries, we provide a script that will :ref:`binaries` to your system.
The script also will download the Docker images to your local registry.

Hyperledger Fabric Samples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We offer a set of sample applications that you may wish to install these
:doc:`samples` before starting with the tutorials as the tutorials leverage
the sample code.

API Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The API documentation for Hyperledger Fabric's Golang APIs can be found on
the godoc site for `Fabric <http://godoc.org/github.com/hyperledger/fabric>`_.
If you plan on doing any development using these APIs, you may want to
bookmark those links now.

Hyperledger Fabric SDKs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hyperledger Fabric intends to offer a number of SDKs for a wide variety of
programming languages. The first two delivered SDKs are the Node.js and Java
SDKs. We hope to provide Python, REST and Go SDKs in a subsequent release.

  * `Hyperledger Fabric Node SDK documentation <https://fabric-sdk-node.github.io/>`__.
  * `Hyperledger Fabric Java SDK documentation <https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-java>`__.

Hyperledger Fabric CA
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hyperledger Fabric provides an optional
`certificate authority service <http://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_
that you may choose to use to generate the certificates and key material
to configure and manage identity in your blockchain network. However, any CA
that can generate ECDSA certificates may be used.
