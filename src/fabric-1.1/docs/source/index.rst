Welcome to Hyperledger Fabric
=============================

Hyperledger Fabric is a platform for distributed ledger solutions, underpinned
by a modular architecture delivering high degrees of confidentiality, resiliency,
flexibility and scalability.  It is designed to support pluggable implementations
of different components, and accommodate the complexity and intricacies that exist
across the economic ecosystem.

Hyperledger Fabric delivers a uniquely elastic and extensible architecture,
distinguishing it from alternative blockchain solutions. Planning for the
future of enterprise blockchain requires building on top of a fully-vetted,
open source architecture; Hyperledger Fabric is your starting point.

It's recommended for first-time users to begin by going through the
:doc:`getting_started` section in order to gain familiarity with the Hyperledger Fabric
components and the basic transaction flow.  Once comfortable, continue
exploring the library for demos, technical specifications, APIs, etc.

.. note:: If you have questions not addressed by this documentation, or run into
          issues with any of the tutorials, please visit the :doc:`questions`
          page for some tips on where to find additional help.
